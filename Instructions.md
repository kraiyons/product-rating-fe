## MVP:

- Front-end: display product rating in vanilla JS / jQuery
- Back-end: store a list of products _and_ product reviews (5-star rating + text for review)

> Using this MVP, add a bunch of ratings to the product.

## V2:

- Migrate the display of the product's rating to React
- Make the display of the rating real-time (e.g. if a new rating is added from another page)
- Update the ratings back-end and front-end to support half-star reviews

### Notes

- We use JavaScript, React, Ruby, Rails, ActiveRecord and MySQL, but your implementation doesn't have to.
- Please structure your commits so that they're easily readable to others.
- Automated tests are encouraged but not required.
- Explain a couple of the big architectural decisions you've made, and anything you would have done differently next time around
